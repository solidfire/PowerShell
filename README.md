The SolidFire PowerShell Tools is a collection of Microsoft速 Windows速 PowerShell functions that use SolidFire API to control a SolidFire storage system.

Users can implement this module with other modules and snap-ins, such as VMware速 PowerCLI and Cisco速 UCS PowerTool, to extend capabilities throughout the infrastructure.
