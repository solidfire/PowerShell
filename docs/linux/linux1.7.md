![solidfire-powershell-logo](../../docs/product.png) ![linux-logo](linux-logo-small.png)

The commands should be run in a terminal session on the machine you want to install on. You don't have to be in a specific directory to execute any of these commands. You will need sudo access. 

## First, Install PowerShell bits
###### CentOS
The following steps ran on CentOS 7.3.

1. Install the rpm package:

    `#sudo rpm -Uvh https://packages.microsoft.com/config/centos/7/packages-microsoft-prod.rpm`

    Then install using yum:

    `#sudo yum install dotnet-sdk-3.1`

2. Install PowerShell:

   `dotnet tool install --global PowerShell`

###### Ubuntu
The Following process worked on Ubuntu Server 18.04. It should be similar with 16.04. 

1. Firstly you need to get the .NET Core SDK Package since the ubuntu package manger doesnâ€™t have any prior knowledge of it. 
   The first this to do is download it using wget:

   `#wget -q https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/18.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb -O packages-microsoft-prod.deb`
   

2. Next you need to install the downloaded package:

   `#sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb`
   
   
3. Once that is done you can install the .NET Core SDK with the following commands:


   `sudo add-apt-repository universe`
   
   `#sudo apt-get update`
   
   `#sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https`
   
   `#sudo apt-get update`
   
   `#sudo apt-get install dotnet-sdk-3.1`
   
4. Install PowerShell:

   `dotnet tool install --global PowerShell`

## Next, Install SolidFire bits

1. Once inside the PowerShell shell, install SolidFire PowerShell Tools for dotnet core by downloading it from the [PowerShell Gallery](powershellgallery.com) with the following command:

        PS> Install-Module -Name SolidFire.Core

1. Then, import the SolidFire module with the following command:

        PS> Import-Module SolidFire.Core

1. To see a list of available commands, use:

        PS> Get-Command -Module SolidFire.Core

**NOTE:** This module used to be called `SolidFire.Linux`. That name has been deprecated and it is now `SolidFire.Core`

## Paths

* `$PSHOME` is `/opt/microsoft/powershell/[version]/`
* User profiles will be read from `~/.config/powershell/profile.ps1`
* Default profiles will be read from `$PSHOME/profile.ps1`
* User modules will be read from `~/.local/share/powershell/Modules`
* Shared modules will be read from `/usr/local/share/powershell/Modules`
* Default modules will be read from `$PSHOME/Modules`
* PSReadLine history will be recorded to `~/.local/share/powershell/PSReadLine/ConsoleHost_history.txt`

The profiles respect PowerShell's per-host configuration,
so the default host-specific profiles exists at `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` in the same locations.

On Linux and macOS, the [XDG Base Directory Specification][xdg-bds] is respected.
